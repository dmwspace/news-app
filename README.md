# React News App

This is a web app located at dean-wright-news-app.herokuapp.com. This simple app allows the user to enter a search term into the text input field to fetch news stories from Newscatchers API. 

### Why I Created This

I created this app because I liked the idea of a simple, cool looking news gathering app. I have seen similar apps created by others and I thought that the simple functionality was intriguing.

### Technologies Used

This application was created using create-react-app. It fetches data from Newscatchers API. I used react-bootstrap for the basic styling of the components and also some inline css styling as well. I used functional components in React to code the app.

### Problems
